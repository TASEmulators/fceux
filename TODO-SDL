Priorities
==========
   * Clean out old unused files - scons build system is dead, cmake is the way to go.
   * GTK GUI was not cross-platform. A Qt5 version of the GUI has been created to meet this need. 
     I will keep the GTK GUI around for Linux users who prefer it, but when it comes to adding new features
     the Qt GUI is where I plan to add them first (if at all).
   * Code cleanup. Lots of compiler warnings with newer GCC. Maybe I'm OCD... but these warnings bother me.

Features
========
   * Emulator no runs as a separate thread from the GUI. Much improved performance.
   * Cross platform QT GUI is fully functional minus Debug Tools.

QT
===
   * Clean out rest of old GTK comments and #ifdefs
	* GUI Debug Tools TODO
   * GUI should compile in windows as well.... but testing is not a priority since the windows gui already has a totally separate backend.

BUGS
====

DOCS
====
	* Docs REALLY need a cleanup/rewrite
