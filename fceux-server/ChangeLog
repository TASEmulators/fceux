0.0.5:
  Interface received massive overhaul.  Now takes command line
  options.  This will allow the server to communicate with
  other front-ends.  Integration can now occur in gfceu.

0.0.4:
  Renamed from "server" to "fceu-server".
	Renamed standard.conf -> fceu-standard.conf
	If no configuration file is specified, look in /etc and ./
	Added a --help option.
	Added GPL headers
	
0.0.3:
  Error messages during server startup are more verbose(slightly).

	Fixed initialization of the sockaddr_in structure, sin_family
	member.  It's now initialized to AF_INET before calling bind().
	While not initializing that member seemed to work ok on 
	Linux 2.4, it won't work on Linux 2.2 and under Cygwin, 
	and possibly other environments.

0.0.2:
  Switched to using fcntl() to set the socket to nonblocking,
  so I don't need to use MSG_NOWAIT in send() anymore, which is
  undefined under Cygwin.

	Added a "clean" Makefile target.

0.0.1:
	First Release
