To compile and install FCEUX for SDL, follow the instructions in the README-SDL.md file.

To compile the netplay server, run "scons fceux-server" or run "make" in the "fceux-server" directory.

Users of Microsoft Visual Studio can use the solution files within the vc directory.
These solution files will compile FCEUX and some included libraries for full functionality.

CMake has been depreciated in favor of scons.  However, if you wish to use it you can find the old cmake build files in the attic.
