1. Requirements
	* libsdl1.2 - It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the latest
		version of sdl (1.2.14).
	* scons - Required to build fceux.
	* libgtk2.0 (optional) - recomended that you install version >= 2.18

2. Installation
	Fceux is installed with the scons utility.  To compile, run:

	scons
	
	After a sucessful compilation, the fceux binary will be generated to 
	./src/fceux .  You can install it to your path with:

	sudo install -m 755 src/fceux /usr/local/bin/fceux

	or by running the install.sh script which executes the same function.

3. Compile-time options
	You can enable and disable certain features of fceux at build time. 
To edit these options, edit the SConstruct file in this source directory.  The
default options here will be fine for most users, but power users may want to
tweak these.

4. GUI
	You can enable the GTK GUI by setting GTK to 1 in the SConstruct build file. 
	Gfceux is deprecatiated in favor of the new GTK GUI.  You can disable it at
	run-time by passing the --nogui 1 option, or disable it build time by setting
	GTK to 0 in the SConstruct file.

5.  FAQ

	Q.  I'm having issues with my sound!
	A.  First of all, for the best sound quality be sure you are using SDL 1.2.14 or later.  Versions 1.2.13 and earlier are known to have problems with fceux!  Next, try different SDL audio drivers to see if this makes any difference.  You can do this by using this command before running fceux:

	export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=driver

	where driver is either:
		pulse for pulseaudio
		alsa for ALSA
		dsp for OSS
		esd for ESD

	There are sound options that you can tweak at runtime through command line switches:

	-soundq x 		internal sound quality hack value (0 off)
	-soundrate x    	sound rate (sane values: 28000 48000
	-soundbuffersize x 	(in ms)  sane values (30, 50, 100, 120)

	* Running fceux through esddsp is known to fix some audio issues with pulseaudio on some older Ubuntu versions.
